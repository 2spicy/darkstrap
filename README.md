# Darkstrap

A dark theme for Twitter Bootstrap 2.

* Darkstrap is just a CSS file that you load after vanilla Bootstrap 2.
* Compatibility with latest Twitter Bootstrap is in progress: https://github.com/danneu/darkstrap/issues/6#issuecomment-11764403

    * Demo (not kept up-to-date): http://darkstrap-unfinished.herokuapp.com/
    * Only tested with Firefox on OSX. 
    * Currently working on cross-browser compatibility!
    * Not ready yet. :(
